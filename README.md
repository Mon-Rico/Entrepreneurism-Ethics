Item 1: Ethical Business Plan

A: Company name: (CKAM) 

B: Long term Vision
1. Our goal is to help students have a fun time learning how to create games.
2. A great way to teach students is to make it fun to learn. Each member has an interest in playing and creating games, and using it as a way to teach students how to create their own. In an ever-changing industry with no shortage of new technology, it's important that students are equipped to adapt to these changes.
3. The purpose of this company is that we want people to learn how to program and to have them create other programs, that is not necessarily about game development as well. The long term values of this company is to have a hobby for people who are interested in and making their own games. If they like programming and game development, they would have some sort of relation to other companies who might hire them to help create or develop existing or new games. 
4. How would this company function and how would it be funded if it is a startup? What are the requirements to be able to join and teach students to be able to learn how to code/run a game? In what ways would this company be more efficient, than let’s say learning from school or self-taught?


C1. OKRs

OKR1: Objectives

Achieve basic understanding of what your goal is when making the game. Since it is for teaching students and not necessarily a school, we should not set a date in which it has to be published/released. 

OKR2: Key results 

Generate a game, and be prepared if it doesn’t work out how you wanted it - remember, it should be one of your first game! No need to make it “perfect.” increase game search via third parties, i.e steam. Played by 100 new users. Generate $50 in revenue. 

OKR3: Improve game development

With the results of at least 50 other users played in games we are able to talk to them about what could improve in their games.

3. Potential ethical impacts: Depending on how much input teachers have in games that students are taught to create, issues may arise concerning credit and intellectual property.

4. Ethical Safeguards:

Item 2 (Cultural Policy):
A. Core Values - What we want to be thought of to other people's perspective of this company, is that we want people to understand that we want to provide the fundamentals of knowing how to program. We want people to think of our company as a stepping stone for inexperienced programmers to have a feel if they want to try to learn programming and eventually how to program games. With this, they can also have connections to other developers and if they decide to do so, they can collaborate with others. The details of the core values of our company is to just try to have fun while developing a game. We do not have a "deadline" to where we want our programmers to create and develop the game; instead we want them to regularly give updates on what they want their games to be about and the goals for
